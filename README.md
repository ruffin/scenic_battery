# Scenic.Battery

A battery monitor component for use in 
[Scenic](https://github.com/boydm/scenic) applications.

Scenic.Battery is a dumb component, so you have to tell it the state yourself.
It doesn't know anything about your machine.

Shamelessly modeled after 
[Scenic.Clock](https://github.com/boydm/scenic_clock).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `scenic_battery` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:scenic_battery, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/scenic_battery](https://hexdocs.pm/scenic_battery).
